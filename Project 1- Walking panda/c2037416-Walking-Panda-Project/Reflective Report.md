## IDE

Using an IDE, makes writing and running code much easier. Features of an IDE include a
syntax highlighting, debugging, code editor, autocompletion and much more.
I have used a couple of python IDEs before, including IDLE and Visual studio.
For this project I used Pycharm. Pycharm made creating this project very easy, due to it being the be all and end all
for all my coding and development needs. Pycharm has various features that made the development of this project really
easy including, a code editor, debugging tools, auto-completion and many more. After this project, I am fairly 
familiar in Pycharm and I will be using it in future python projects.

## Markdown 

Using a markdown is great for storing information about a project together with the project.
It stores it in a text file within the same folder as the project, and can be opened within the IDE.
Examples of information a markdown would include are copyright rules and documentation of the code.
For this project, I included three markdown files: Reflective Report.md, README.md and LICENSE.md

## Version Control

Version control allows you to track and manage changes to code. This protects the previous code
from being broken when new code is written. I used git in this project. This allowed me to make edits to my code, knowing
that if I somehow really messed up my code. I could go back to my working code and remove all the changes I made.
This is great, especially when working on projects as a team of people, using software like Github, to simultaneously 
write code without messing up each others code and the functionality of the code overall.

## Dependency Management, Sandboxing & Libraries

Dependency management, sandboxing and the use of libraries makes codes much easier. 
It allows different functions to be written in different files and call each other.
This allows you to separate and organise your code. As well as call functions 
programmed by other people and use them in your code. I used the panda3d library for this code. I also
separated my code into different files for organisation. These files are called walking_panda.py, panda.py and cli.py

## RTM

A RTM or a requirements traceability matrix records various tests of code and their outputs.
This allows the programmer to check their code has worked as planned and to trace their
code to see where it has gone wrong. A common form of this is using print statements, to check which parts of code 
has run and to output variables at certain times to see how their values change throughout the steps of code.
